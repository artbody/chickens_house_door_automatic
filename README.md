# chickens_house_door_automatic
Opening of a chickens house door if Sunlight or with a manual switch. A Arduino pro micro is used

You'll need some additional arduino secific libraries that the code will compile
Arduino pro micro libraries from sparcfun 
and the LowPower Lib 
https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power

The Idea was very simple, 
a motor with gear reduction found on amazon Greartisan DC 5V 0.5RPM https://www.amazon.de/dp/B071KHXQP9?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1,  
one driver from DollaTek L298N ,  
one Arduino Pro Micro,  
a LDR for light detection ,  
a poti for reference ,  
a 3 position switch -> On Off || Off Off || Off On ,  
2 switches for open and closed end positions , 

and the Powersupply , therefore i use a 7.4V Lion Accu 5000mA  with a StepDown converter , 

some cables and your mechanical door construction, 

have fun
